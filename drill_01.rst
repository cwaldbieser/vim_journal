============

Movement Drills
---------------

* hjkl
* w-e-b, W-E-B
* f-t , ;
* g0 gm g$
* H M L
* { } ( )

This is a very long line and it is going to wrap around. How do I know? I am just going to type for a long time, even if I am not saying anything particularly profound. It will be a fair amount of content, but for most screens, it will be more than 1 screen line. This is one more sentence.


Relative Number
---------------

This is a line.
Another line.
A third line.
A fine line.
Do all these lines make you you see double?
Don't erase this line!!!
Last line.

Spell Checking
--------------

First, `setlocal spell`.  Then use "]s" and "[s" to navigate.  Finally, use
"z=" to prompt for corrections.

This paragrapj is filled with spelling rrors because I decided to type it
without looking at the screen.  Instead I decided to watch my fingers.  It is
funny that I only use the Middle finger on my left hand while I type.  I use
the left thumb to hit the space bar, but the pinky just kind of dnagles out
there.  Anyway, I hope I have lots of spelling errors to correct.

This is a 2nd paragraph.  Maybe there are some more purpiseful mispellings
here.  Some words are just hard to spell, like calander and accquire.  I'm not
sure what makes a word difficult to spell.  One factor is that it can't be
phoenetic.  That would make it easy to spell, but what if the letters that can
produce the phenomes are ambiguous?  That would be a real pickle.

80 Cols
-------

This paragraph is a great example of some text that exceeds 80 columns.  It is too long for some screens, and thus will wrap.  On my laptop, the wrapping doesn't seem to occur until well over 180 columns at the font size I like to use.  I appear to be using *Monospace Regular* 12 point font.  That is smaller than I recall using.  In all the AWS Cloud9 environments that I use, I bump the font-size up to 17.  I wonder if that is in points or pixels?
